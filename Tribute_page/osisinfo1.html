                About the Run Machine/King Kohli
            </h1>
            <p>
                Virat kohli is the best batsman in the world right now across formates. With each passing year,he has gotten better. he is b2 now and intends to be around for another 7 years. Gives his form and fitness,thst is very much on the cards. should that happen,One
                wonders what are the records he is going to pile up. Kohli is a run Machine. His appetite for big scores is what has worked in india's favour over the past decade . From a talented youngster,he evolved into a new sensation and then become
                a modern-day great.By the time he retires,he will have been a legend . In fact,some would say he already is. He ia already the highest international run-getter amoung active plyers. IF he keeps it up he could finish on the top of the charts
                by the time the curtains come down on his carrer. Truth be told, the records he sets may not be broken anytime soon. People called him the next sachine tendulkar.But in reality,he is first virat kohli , with no apparent weakeness and habit
                of consistency ,virat is expected to pile on the runs in the coming years. For all we know ,the best may be yet to come. Kohli has 43 ODI centuries to his name,apart from 27 tons in test cricket the india captain has surpassed the 11,000-run
                mark in the ODls and has an average of 59.33.
